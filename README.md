# Verilog_Compressors
In this repo, I am sharing the verilog codes for differnt-differnt exact (accurate) 4:2 compressors means 5 inputs and 3 outputs and 3:2 compressors means 4 inputs and 2 outputs,
I have taken all the recent compressors available in the literature, and make them using verilog on vivado design suite (version 2023.2), 
Below are the citations of the designs as well, which I have used and make their compressor designs.
Design_1 is the conventional 4:2 compressor,
